## Hi I'm Haoyu Wu(吴豪宇）

Welcome to my Github! I am currently a forth-year undergraduate at RUC seeking for a 25 fall PhD position. My research interest lies in Video Generation and Diffusion Models.  I have worked as an visiting student at HKUST, supervised by Prof. Qifeng Chen. Now I am an intern at ML group, MSRA, supervised by Dr. Junliang Guo.
